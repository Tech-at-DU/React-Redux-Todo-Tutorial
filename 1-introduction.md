# **React + Redux To-Do List Tutorial**

## **Introduction**
Managing **application state** is a critical skill in React development. In this tutorial, you will build a **To-Do List application** using **React and Redux Toolkit**, learning how to efficiently manage state in a structured way.

### **Why Use Redux for a To-Do List?**
A basic to-do list can be built using Reactâ€™s `useState`, but as applications grow, managing state across multiple components becomes complex. **Redux Toolkit** provides a centralized way to manage state, ensuring:
- âœ… A **single source of truth** for to-dos across components.  
- âœ… **Predictable state updates** using reducers and actions.  
- âœ… **Scalability**, allowing easy expansion with filters, priorities, and persistence.  

### **Who is this Tutorial For?**
This tutorial is designed for developers who:
- âœ… Have **basic React knowledge** (components, `useState`, `useEffect`).  
- âœ… Want to learn **Redux Toolkit** for structured state management.  
- âœ… Are comfortable with **JavaScript ES6+** (`map`, `filter`, arrow functions`).  

### **What You Will Learn**
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- âœ… Use **Redux Toolkit (`configureStore`, `createSlice`)** to manage state.  
- âœ… Connect Redux to React using **`useSelector` and `useDispatch`**.  
- âœ… Implement actions and reducers to handle **adding, updating, and deleting** tasks.  
- âœ… Enhance the to-do app with **state persistence, filters, and sorting**.

## **Project Overview**
### **Features of the To-Do List App:**
- âœ… Add tasks dynamically.  
- âœ… Mark tasks as completed or active.  
- âœ… Delete tasks.  
- âœ… Display task list from Redux state.  
- âœ… Store tasks persistently (Stretch Goal).  

### **Technologies Used:**
- **React** for building UI components.  
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management.  
- **React-Redux** for connecting Redux to React components.
